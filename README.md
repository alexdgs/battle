# Battle

A "Battle City" clone with some adds. My first Java 2D game project.

This project was for Java 2D learning purposes, hence the lack of 'good practices'; will try to insert some comments soon.

I think somebody can pick something useful for other Java 2D projects.

I don't ripped the images and sounds used here, nor remember where they were downloaded from.

Project created in Eclipse IDE Mars

P.D.: The cat powerup was a 'family contribution'.
